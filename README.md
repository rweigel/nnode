Neural network code for solving ordinary differential equations

This code is my first attempt at implementing the Lagaris et al method for using neural networks to solve differential equations. This first version only handles 1st-order ODEs.

Reference: Lagaris et al, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 8(5), p. 987 (1998).
